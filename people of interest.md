KAREL ČAPEK

Czech Writer | 1890 –  1938 

a Czech writer of the early 20th century, filled multiple roles during his career, including those of playwright, dramatist,

essayist, publisher, literary reviewer, photographer, and art critic. He is known as a science fiction author, 

who wrote before science fiction became widely recognized as a separate genre. Many of his works also discuss ethical aspects

of industrial inventions and processes already anticipated in the first half of the 20th century. 

These include mass production, nuclear weapons and intelligent artificial beings such as robots or androids, 

including his 1936 novel War with the Newts and 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), which introduced the word robot.

Karel Čapek introduced and made popular the frequently used international word robot in 1920. 

While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word, he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in 

the Oxford English Dictionary etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its actual inventor.
