I think programming is typing code until it forms at least a line and then you run it and something comes on screen(Errors count).

A loop is a reading area of code that can perform an action many times avoiding the need to write the same thing over and over again.

A function is a cluster of code that you can call with a line making the main code cleaner and easier to read.

Yes I did get far enought to conditional.

A conditionnal is an action that executes only and only if a condition is met
